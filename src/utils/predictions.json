For example, \\max(3, 5, 4) = 5, \\max(1, 7, 7) = 7, \\max(6, 2) = 6.\n\n# Input description\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \\le t \\le 200). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 100)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the arrays.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (1 \\le a_i \\le 100)\u00a0\u2014 elements of the first array.\nThe third line of each test case contains n integers b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n (1 \\le b_i \\le 100)\u00a0\u2014 elements of the second array.\n\n# Output description\nFor each test case, print \"Yes\" if after using any (possibly zero) number of operations the conditions described above are satisfied. Otherwise, print \"No\".\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\n# Test case 1\n## Input 1\n```\n7\n3\n7 9 7\n7 6 9\n4\n10 10 15 15\n10 16 15 15\n2\n100 99\n99 100\n1\n1\n1\n9\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 6 6 6\n7\n1 1 2 2 1 1 2\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1\n2\n30 4\n5 30\n```\n## Expected output 1\n```\nYes\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\n```\n\n# Explanation of the test cases\nIn the first test case, you can swap the numbers a_3 and b_3, after which the array a becomes equal to [7, 9, 9], and the array b becomes equal to [7, 6, 7], and both conditions are met.\nIn the second test case, it can be proved that it is impossible to satisfy both conditions.\nIn the third test case, you can swap the numbers a_1 and b_1, after which the array a becomes equal to [99, 99], and the array b becomes equal to [100, 100], and both conditions are satisfied.\nIn fifth test case, you can swap a_7 and b_7, a_8 and b_8, a_9 and b_9, after which the array a becomes equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6], and the array b becomes equal to [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 8, 9], and both conditions are satisfied.\n\n\nThe input should be read from the standard input and the output should be passed to the standard output.\nReturn Python code that solves the problem.
